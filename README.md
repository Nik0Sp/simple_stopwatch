<h1 align="center">Stopwatch</h1>

<p align="center">
  <strong>A simple stopwatch application built with React.</strong>
</p>

##  Getting Started

To use this stopwatch, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Change directory to the project folder: `cd your-repo`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the stopwatch in action.

##  Features

- The stopwatch displays the elapsed time in the format `MM:SS:MS` (minutes:seconds:milliseconds).
- Clicking the "Start" button starts the stopwatch, and the time starts incrementing.
- Clicking the "Stop" button pauses the stopwatch, and the time stops incrementing.
- Clicking the "Reset" button stops the stopwatch and resets the time to 0.

## Usage

The main component of the stopwatch is `Stopwatch`, which manages the state and functionality of the stopwatch.

### Stopwatch

The `Stopwatch` component is responsible for the following:

- The `time` state variable stores the elapsed time in milliseconds.
- The `isRunning` state variable determines whether the stopwatch is running or paused.
- The `useEffect` hook updates the `time` state every 10 milliseconds when the stopwatch is running.
- The `formatTime` function formats the elapsed time into the `MM:SS:MS` format.
- The `handleStartStop` function toggles the `isRunning` state when the "Start/Stop" button is clicked.
- The `handleReset` function stops the stopwatch and resets the `time` state to 0 when the "Reset" button is clicked.
